# Stock-Quote-API-Demo-Project

This project is being made with the intent of completing the following challenge:

Create a Stock Quote application using Swift
Application should work on iPhone and iPad in any orientation
The primary/root view controller should be a Table View which lists Stock Symbols and their current trading price (pick a random set of companies to display, e.g. MSFT, GOOG, etc)
Tapping on a Stock Quote should load a detail view controller, displaying detailed information about a Stock (high, low, average, etcâ€¦whatever you want)
Stock quotes should be retrieved asynchronously from a source on the Internet. Use whatever network library/mechanism you prefer to make your network requests (e.g. AFNetwork, NSURLSession, etc)
One free API you could use is Yahoo Finance via the YQL console
The source you select for Stock quotes should provide JSON. Use whatever mechanism you prefer to parse the JSON, and render the content in your App
You must show thorough unit and UI test coverage.
Please deliver your code via Github 
Take as much time as you need, but track your progress with frequent commits
